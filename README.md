The Google Play Store, formerly known as Android Market, serves as a significant digital distribution platform for various content types including apps, books, music, movies, and more. As the Android ecosystem continues to expand rapidly, performing data analysis over the data becomes crucial for extracting valuable insights beneficial for app development businesses. 
This project focuses on conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Google Play Store dataset to derive actionable insights that can guide developers towards creating successful apps and capturing the Android market effectively.
