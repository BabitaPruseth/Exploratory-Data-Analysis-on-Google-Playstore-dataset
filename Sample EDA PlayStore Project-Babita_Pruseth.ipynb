found?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["By processing data related to apps on the Google Play Store, collected some valuable insights into user preferences, market trends, and potential areas for app development, shown as follows:\n","\n","1.\tThe ratio of positive to negative ratings being 28.892857142857142 indicates the proportion of positive ratings compared to negative ratings. Specifically, this ratio suggests that for every negative rating in the dataset, there are approximately 28.89 positive ratings. This high ratio could imply that the majority of ratings in the dataset are positive, showing that users generally have a favourable opinion of the apps or content in the dataset\n","\n","2. By comparing apps and ratings, revealed insights about which apps are perceived positively or negatively by users, it indicates the relationship between app performance (in terms of ratings) and user perception. Here it shown the count of positive ratings between 4 and 5 is 7739 and count of negative ratings between 1 and 2 is 66. There is a large number of users who are satisfied with the apps. This could indicate that the apps in the dataset generally meet or exceed user expectations, providing quality features, functionality, and user experience.\n","\n","3.\tI created a new column named as ‘App_age’ by calculating the age of the app from its last update until now, which shows how actively the app is maintained its level of support and engagement, its competitiveness in the market, and its overall health and potential for future success. This information can guide decisions about whether to invest in or continue using the app. \n","\n","4.\tBy calculating mean rating by categories, it shown a scenario between categories with different ratings. Categories with higher mean ratings may align more closely with user preferences and needs. This can help to understand what types of apps users are more satisfied with, which can be focused areas for developers to create successful apps. Categories with lower mean ratings may present opportunities for improvement and innovation. The top 10 categories with the highest ratings on this dataset fall between approximately 4.2 and 4.4 on average where, events, education, art_and_design, books_and_reference, personalization, parenting having ~4.4 rating and beauty, game, health_and_fitness, social showing ~4.2.\n","\n","5.\tBy counting the number of apps by category and identifying the category with the highest count, provides information of the competitive landscape of the app market and potential areas for new development and investment. Based on our dataset, indicated that the category with the highest count of apps on the Play Store is ‘family’ with a maximum count of 1,939 apps. Additionally, the mean review score for this category is approximately 204,627. The \"family\" category is the most saturated category on the Play Store, suggesting a high level of competition within this category. The mean review score for the category is high (204,627), which suggests that, on average, apps in the \"family\" category receive a significant amount of user reviews. The high count of apps in the \"family\" category and the significant mean review score suggest that there is strong demand for family-oriented apps on the Play Store. This demand may present opportunities for developers to innovate and create new, high-quality family apps to meet user needs. \n","\n","6.\tIdentified top 10 categories by correlating app counts with average reviews and ratings, indicates the most successful categories and design app content that aligns with market trends and user preferences. \"FAMILY\" and \"GAME\" categories have the highest number of apps, as well as favourable mean ratings and reviews.\n","\n","7.\tExtracted the largest apps in each category may indicate apps that are resource-intensive, requiring more storage and potentially more processing power. Listed the top 10 largest apps in each category. The data includes various categories such as game, finance, family, health and fitness, sports, and lifestyle. The apps in each category seem to be ranked based on the app's size, with each app listed having a size of 100 M. The list includes several game apps, such as \"Stickman Legends: Shadow Wars\", \"Car Crash III Beam DH Real Damage Simulator 2018\", \"Hungry Shark Evolution\", \"Mini Golf King - Multiplayer Game\", and \"Miami crime simulator\". By knowing their features, user experience and overall design, it can be revealed their success and popularity behind the apps. This information can guide developers in creating new games that appeal to similar audiences.\n","\n","8.\tBy calculating the total number of installs by app and content rating, it provided a scenario about user preferences, which helps the developers to adjust their strategy accordingly for app development and marketing purpose.\n","\n","9.\tHere calculated the average rating for free and paid apps. The average rating for free apps is 4.19, slightly lower than for paid apps i.e. 4.26. while there is a small difference in average ratings between free and paid apps, the ratings for both types of apps suggest general satisfaction among users. Developers can use this information to tailor their app strategies based on their target audience and the type of app they are offering. Identified the top 10 free apps with a perfect rating of 5.0 and a varying number of reviews, indicating extremely high user satisfaction. Apps with higher review counts and perfect ratings, such as \"Ríos de Fe\" and \"FD Calculator (EMI, SIP, RD & Loan Eligibility),\" may be considered particularly reliable and consistent in terms of quality. Apps with perfect ratings but a low review count may need further analysis to verify their authenticity and consistency. The apps listed are from a variety of types, including religious apps, calculators, photography, technology news, interview questions, and more, suggests that high-quality free apps can be successful across a range of categories. By analysing top 10 paid apps on reviews and rating, shown all of the apps have perfect ratings of 5.0, but review counts for these apps are generally low, ranging from 4 to 13 reviews. Although perfect ratings are rare and indicative of quality, low review counts mean these ratings may not be as representative of broader user sentiment. The list of apps includes a variety of types, including watch faces, music-related apps, communication tools, and icon packs.\n","\n","10.\tBy grouping the content rating (e.g., Everyone, Teen, Mature 17+) based on category, indicates the type of content typically found in each app category. It Helps to understand which categories and content ratings to target based on their audience's age and content preferences.\n","\n","11.\tCorrelation between paid apps, category, and price, helps to understand how pricing strategies vary across different app categories and guide strategic decisions in app development and marketing. Top 10 apps are sorted based on price, and it appears to include apps from various categories, including lifestyle, family, and finance. The apps in the list are sorted by their prices in descending order and have high prices, often around 399.99 USD or more. Lifestyle apps seem to be the most prevalent in the list, suggesting a focus on luxury or exclusive experiences in these apps. The ratings vary across the apps, ranging from 3.5 to 4.4, indicates that high price does not necessarily correlate with higher ratings. Many apps have names related to wealth, such as \"I'm Rich,\" \"I Am Rich Pro,\" or similar phrases, suggest that the apps may be marketed towards users interested in luxury or exclusivity.\n","\n","12.\tAgain figured out the top 10 paid apps with the highest number of reviews. Most apps in the list are games, such as \"Minecraft,\" \"Hitman Sniper,\" \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,\" and others. Even all the apps listed have a significant number of reviews, ranging from 97,890 to 4,751,900. A high number of reviews suggests these apps have a large user base and are popular choices among paid apps.\n","\n","These are common manipulations and insights have been done with this Play Store dataset. \n","\n"," "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GF8Ens_Soomf"},"source":["## ***4.
